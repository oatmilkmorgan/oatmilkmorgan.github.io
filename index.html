  <h2>a place for all the things i love</h2>



<p>i wanted to have an excuse to show off all of my hobbies and interests and passions and joys and this must be the place!</p>

<p>this includes…</p>



<ul>

  <li>playlists i can’t get enough of</li>

  <li>film photos i’ve recently taken and developed</li>

  <li>and a whole biography dedicated to my beloved kitten, elio.</li>

</ul>



<p>i hope this site helps give a little insight into who i am as a person, something i find becomes harder and harder to conceptualize the longer i have been in quarantine the past few months.</p>
