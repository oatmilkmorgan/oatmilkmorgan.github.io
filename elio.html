<p>this september, i left my house for the dane county humane society alone and came back home with my pride and joy: a little orange kitten who i promptly named elio and vowed to love for the rest of his days. while he’s given me countless scratches and cat food expenses, he has also given me a purpose in this world and an extra reason to smile. i love him so much.</p>
